## 2° Step

1. Install the [**Baldur's Gate 3 Mod Manager**](https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager/releases/latest/download/BG3ModManager_Latest.zip)

2. After downloading the Mod Manager, extract it anywhere you want then run the .exe, after running the .exe the Mod Manager should automatically detect the pathways to the game data and exe.

If it fails, manually set the pathways in `Settings -> Preferences, click 'Save', then click the 'Refresh' button` so the campaign mod data is loaded.
