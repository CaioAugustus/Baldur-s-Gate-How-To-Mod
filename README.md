# Baldur-s-Gate-How-To-Mod
So you're looking to install some mods, that's good
but be advised **MODS CAN BREAK EXISTING SAVES**

But let's start

# 1° Step
Have the game (that's important) and then start a game, just once to make sure.
But to use the Baldur's Gate 3 mod manager you'll need [.NET 8.0 Desktop Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-8.0.22-windows-x64-installer?cid=getdotnetcore) and the [latest C++ redistributable](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)
Then we're gonna install [Script Extender](https://github.com/CaioAugustus/Baldur-s-Gate-How-To-Mod/raw/refs/heads/main/DWrite.dll)
