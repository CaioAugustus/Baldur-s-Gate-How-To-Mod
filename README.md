## Step 1 — Script Extender

**Official Source Here: https://github.com/Norbyte/bg3se**

1. Download the Script Extender below:
   [**Script Extender**]([https://github.com/CaioAugustus/Baldur-s-Gate-How-To-Mod/raw/refs/heads/main/DWrite.dll](https://github.com/CaioAugustus/Baldur-s-Gate-How-To-Mod/raw/refs/heads/main/Norbyte's%20Baldur's%20Gate%203%20Beta%20Script%20Extender-2172-2024April-30-1715333040.7z))

2. Place the `DWrite.dll` file into the game's **bin** folder:

   1. Open Steam  
   2. Right-click **Baldur’s Gate 3** → Properties  
   3. Go to **Installed Files**  
   4. Click **Browse...**  
   5. Open the `bin` folder  
   6. Paste the `DWrite.dll` file there


3. After placing the Script Extender on the bin folder **start the game once more** to register that you have the extender

### What is Script Extender?
The Script Extender allows more advanced mods to work on Baldur's Gate 3 - It expands the scripting support of the game. Without it, many mods that use more complex features may not work.

## Step 2 - Mod Manager

**Oficcial Source Here: https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager?tab=readme-ov-file** 

1. Install the [**Baldur's Gate 3 Mod Manager**](https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager/releases/latest/download/BG3ModManager_Latest.zip)

2. After downloading the Mod Manager, Extract it anywhere you want (Desktop is recommended), then run the `.exe`. After running the .exe the Mod Manager should automatically detect the pathways to the game data and exe.

If it fails, manually set the pathways in `Settings -> Preferences, click 'Save', then click the 'Refresh' button` so the campaign mod data is loaded.

3. Organize your active mods for the profile Public, then click the first export button (Export Load Order to Game), or click File -> Export Order to Game, to export your active load order to the game. This updates the modsettings.lsx file that the game reads.
