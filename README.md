# Baldur-s-Gate-How-To-Mod
So you're looking to install some mods, that's good
but be advised **MODS CAN BREAK EXISTING SAVES**

But let's start

# 1° Step
- Have the game (that's important) and then start a game if you haven't before, to create a profile and mods folder.

- Make sure you have [.NET 8.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-8.0.22-windows-x64-installer?cid=getdotnetcore) and the [latest C++ redistributable](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)

- Then we're gonna install [Script Extender](https://github.com/CaioAugustus/Baldur-s-Gate-How-To-Mod/raw/refs/heads/main/DWrite.dll) (because many mods need this)
  When you have installed the [Script Extender](https://github.com/CaioAugustus/Baldur-s-Gate-How-To-Mod/raw/refs/heads/main/DWrite.dll), put the DLL on the BG3 (Baldur's Gate 3) Bin folder
  to access the bin folder do this: Steam > BG3 > Properties > Installed Files > Browse... > bin > and just throw the DLL there and it's done ( start the game once more just to register on the files that you have the DLL)
