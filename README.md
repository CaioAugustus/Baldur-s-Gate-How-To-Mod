1. Download the Script Extender below:
   [**Script Extender**](https://github.com/CaioAugustus/Baldur-s-Gate-How-To-Mod/raw/refs/heads/main/DWrite.dll)

### What is Script Extender?
The Script Extender allows more advanced mods to work on Baldur's Gate 3 - He expands scripting support of the game. Without him, many mods that use more complex features may not work.

   `Steam -> Baldur's Gate 3 -> Properties -> Installed Files -> Browse... -> bin`

3. After placing the Script Extender on the bin folder **start the game once more** to register that you have the extender

## 2° Step

1. Install the [**Baldur's Gate 3 Mod Manager**](https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager/releases/latest/download/BG3ModManager_Latest.zip)

2. After downloading the Mod Manager, extract it anywhere you want then run the .exe, after running the .exe the Mod Manager should automatically detect the pathways to the game data and exe.

If it fails, manually set the pathways in `Settings -> Preferences, click 'Save', then click the 'Refresh' button` so the campaign mod data is loaded.

3. Organize your active mods for the profile Public, then click the first export button (Export Load Order to Game), or click File -> Export Order to Game, to export your active load order to the game. This updates the modsettings.lsx file that the game reads.
